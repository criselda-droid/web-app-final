          <h4>Qoutes 1</h4>
          <q>No amount of security advice is helpful if it is not implemented. Unfortunately, many people will read IT magazines or columns such as Schneier on Security, 
            but then neglect to put what they learn into practice. 
            </q>

        <div>
          <h4>Qoutes 2</h4>
          <q>It's also vital for businesses to provide their IT departments with powerful security tools. Without suitable software, cybersecurity professionals 
            are not equipped to conduct security monitoring if they lack the right programs to do the job.</q>

        <h3>Journal Entry 1</h3>
        <p>Day 1 of Investigation:</p>
        <p>Cyberattack at Samsan Tech</p>
        <p> When a company called Samsan Tech launched their self-driving car, 
            that's where they face a problem called ransomware their CEO was shocked. Their CEO Seo Dal Mi 
            immediately call for help and find someone who might help. I was happened to be one of her closest friend
            so I was the first one she called that moment, it also happened to be that day that I was in Korea to meet a client. 
            I have learned that in order to allow the new developer to work from home, 
            the developers at Samsan Tech opened up port 22 on one of their office computers. 
            Port 22 gave the new developer access to the command line 
            of the office computer, also known as an SSH connection. </p>
